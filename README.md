# MALIK // Status Terminal

A personal, Fallout-inspired life tracker: S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats, skills, main / side / daily quests,
inventory, a Caps wallet, and a journal that turns diary entries into XP and skill proposals you
accept or reject.

Plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript: no framework, no build step.

**Hosted on GitHub Pages:** https://jaydenresendes64-create.github.io/PIBBOY/

## Project layout

```
index.html          markup
css/terminal.css    styles
js/state.js         data model, defaults, reward rules, backup validation
js/storage.js       saving: IndexedDB with a localStorage fallback, backup files
js/ai.js            journal analysis client + offline keyword rules
js/render.js        builds each tab
js/events.js        user actions
js/main.js          startup
api/analyze.js      optional serverless AI function (not used on GitHub Pages, see below)
.nojekyll           tells GitHub Pages to serve the files as they are, without Jekyll
```

## Hosting (GitHub Pages)

The app is a static site served by GitHub Pages from this repository:
**Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → `main` / root.** Every push to `main` is live at
https://jaydenresendes64-create.github.io/PIBBOY/ a minute or two later.

There is no server and no API key. The journal uses the offline keyword rules in `js/ai.js`, and the
footer shows `AI analysis: offline rules`.

## Run it locally

Double-click `index.html`. Everything works the same as on GitHub Pages.

## Your data

- Saved in the browser you use (IndexedDB, falling back to localStorage). Another browser or device
  starts empty. Use **Export backup / Import backup** in the footer to move it.
- **Coming from the Claude version:** open it in Claude, click **Export backup**, then **Import backup**
  in this app.
- With the offline rules, diary entries never leave your browser.
- This repository is public: never commit a backup file or a key. `.gitignore` excludes both.

## Optional: AI analysis (not used on GitHub Pages)

`api/analyze.js` is a serverless function that sends a diary entry to an AI model. GitHub Pages can't
run it or keep a secret, so the live site never calls it. It only matters if you ever move the app to a
host that runs serverless functions (such as Vercel); there, the footer shows `AI analysis: on` once
the key is set, and the diary text is sent to the AI provider for analysis.

| Variable         | Required | Default                      | Notes                                         |
|------------------|----------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | yes      | none                         | OpenAI key, or an Azure OpenAI key            |
| `AI_MODEL`       | no       | `gpt-4o-mini`                | model name, or your Azure deployment name     |
| `AI_BASE_URL`    | no       | `https://api.openai.com/v1`  | any OpenAI-compatible `/v1` base URL          |

**OpenAI:** at platform.openai.com, create a project just for this app, give it a monthly budget
limit, and create the key inside it. For a restricted key, enable **Model capabilities** (that covers
`/v1/chat/completions`) and leave everything else at None; if calls fail with a missing
`model.request` scope, use a key with **All** permissions in that dedicated project instead. The
project must be allowed to use the model in `AI_MODEL`. One entry costs roughly 300 input and
50 output tokens.

**Azure OpenAI** (for example with Student Pack credit): deploy `gpt-4o-mini`, then set
`OPENAI_API_KEY` to the Azure key, `AI_BASE_URL` to `https://<resource>.openai.azure.com/openai/v1`
and `AI_MODEL` to the deployment name.

The function only accepts a diary entry and returns a reward proposal (it builds the prompt itself and
caps input and output), so it can't be used as a general proxy to the model. The budget limit is still
your real cost guard. Keep keys in the host's environment settings or in a `.env.local` file, which
`.gitignore` keeps out of the repository.

# PIBBOY optimization log

Newest first. Each entry: what changed, files, tests actually run.

## 2026-10-22 — Urge decoder record (plan tasks 1-3)
- `js/state.js`: urge `active` and log entries gain `intensity`, `trigger`, `copes`; log entries gain
  `outcome`, `note`, `hour`, `t`; `urges.copes` (player's ways). New: `setUrgeDetail`, `urgeLapsed`,
  `noteUrge`, `addCope`, `removeCope`, `copeById`. `urgesToday()` counts only urges ridden out (the
  XP cap). Sanitizer rebuilds every new field (old entries read as ridden out).
- `js/insight.js`: `urgePatterns()`, `bestCope()`; `ctx-cope` suggestion first while the timer runs;
  urge counts in TREND and context use ridden-out urges only.
- `js/vitals.js`: running/over phases show intensity slider, trigger chips, coping chips (+ Mine,
  Edit), "I gave in"; one-line note after an outcome; patterns and "Last urges" on the start card.
- `js/render.js`: STATUS "Urges ridden out" no longer counts lapses.
- `css/terminal.css`: chips, details, note box, patterns, history. `sw.js` cache v37.
- Tests: `node --test` → 338 pass, 0 fail (new `tests/urges.test.js`: 10). Chromium end to end:
  details → "I gave in" → note (Enter) → history → reload: all kept, no page errors.
